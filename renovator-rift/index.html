            <p>This project was part of a four-week mini-module in the second semester of my second year at my
                university called Games Studio, where the whole class would form one massive studio to collaborate and
                make one game.
                My official role in this project was producer (which was decided by the lecturers).
                In the first phases, I had to interview people to figure out who would be my leads for the tech, art,
                and design departs, and from there, we interviewed people to see what department they wanted to join/fit
                in.
                During the four weeks, my daily tasks included overseeing the project's progress, making sure tasks are
                completed on time, guiding the direction of the project in order to meet deadline, reviewing newly
                created features, and planning the next steps.</p>
