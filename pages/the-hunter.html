            <p>The Hunter is a game that I developed within two weeks for the Acerola Jam 0. I used some of my pixel art drawings and the public Kingdom repository assets to create it. The game's narrative is a spin-off of the original Kingdom lore. In it, the player takes on the role of a hunter tasked with destroying all trolls from the world.
                I used this project to showcase my programming abilities. I implemented mechanics and systems, such as AI, combat, movement, spawning, audio, saving and loading, and even a tiny settings menu. Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience.</p>
