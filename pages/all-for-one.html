            <p>This is a project I developed for the Brackeys 2021.1 Game Jam with Arnas Puskinigis. It is a top-down 2D shooter set in space, where the player controls a spaceship under enemy attack. The goal is to destroy as many enemies as possible and avoid running out of ammo by collecting ammo boxes.
                I primarily focused on the tech side of the game, working on the game systems, such as NPCs, player movement and combat, and enemy spawning. </p>
