            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Renovator Rift is a 2D platformer set inside a spaceship that has been stranded in space after sustaining
                significant damage, making it the player's objective to repair it. This was a four-week academic project
                as part of my Game Studio Module at my university, where students from the Games Development and Games
                Programming courses formed a single ’Game Studio’.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="contributions">
            <h3>Personal Contributions</h3>
            <p>I was selected by the faculty to serve as the Producer for this project. Before it began, I interviewed
                my fellow students to understand their skills better and to choose my department leads (Design, Art, and
                Programming). My daily tasks included overseeing the project's progress, ensuring tasks were completed
                on time, guiding the project to meet the deadline, reviewing newly developed features, and planning the
                next steps.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="challenges">
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>The main challenge was that I had never led a large group towards a common goal, so this was an ideal
                opportunity to refine my leadership and project management skills. </p>
        </section>

        <section id="outcome">
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>Although it was a difficult challenge, my team and I came through and submitted our game, earning the
                best submission in this module from the faculty and achieving a grade of 92%.</p>
