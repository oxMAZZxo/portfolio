            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>An Acerola Game Jam 0 submission. Given the theme of aberration, I decided to make a game about literal
                aberrations: the trolls (enemies in the game), with the player's mission to destroy them. I also used
                this game as an academic project for my Work-Based Learning module, demonstrating my ability to work
                under strict time constraints and achieve a good overall outcome.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="contributions">
            <h3>Personal Contributions</h3>
            <p>I designed and implemented mechanics and systems, such as AI, combat, movement, spawning, audio, saving
                and loading, and even a tiny settings menu.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="tech-dets">
            <h3>Technical Details</h3>
            <p>With only two weeks for the game jam, I knew I had time to create something ambitious, but I still needed
                to plan how I would manage my time during development. I decided to concentrate on the game's design and
                programming while outsourcing the art. Most notably, I used the publicly available Kingdom assets from
                Noio, which were utilised in the original Kingdom flash game.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="challenges">
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>When I created this game, I was not an advanced programmer; it took me some time to develop the water
                reflection shader and the enemy AI. However, continuous playtesting and debugging helped me resolve
                issues such as the AI not attacking or ignoring the player, among other problems.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="outcome">
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>The game received an overall positive review from players, and although I received some fair criticism
                for certain game design choices, I am quite happy with what I produced, given the time I had and the
                other projects I was working on.</p>
