            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>A skateboarding game featuring a runtime procedurally generated map and swipe-based controls. Game
                started as an academic project meant to showcase my technical ability as a programmer by implementing
                features such as the procedurally generated map, and optimising the system to run smoothly on mobile
                platforms.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="contributions">
            <h3>Personal Contributions</h3>
            <p>Designed and implemented all of the game systems with scalability and replay-ability in mind, all while
                considering mobile platform restrictions such as memory and performance limitations, as well as
                considering release to Google Play (currently in internal testing).</p>
        </section>

        <section id="tech-dets">
            <h3>Technical Details</h3>
            <p>Procedurally generated map uses Scriptable objects that define the relationship between different
                obstacles and create object pools that contain each impediment that can be ‘spawned’ in the game.</p>
            <p>Custom Touch Control Tool calculates swipe directions based on start and end input and invokes events
                that can be subscribed to, passing on the swipe direction, and any other game system can react
                accordingly. Although this tool doesn’t handle complex swipe gestures, it was very much an experimental
                feature for me, as it was my first time creating something like this.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="challenges">
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>A major challenge was optimising the system. Many design changes were needed to improve the
                procedural map, which not only spawns random obstacles but also considers their relationships. For
                example, spawning a bench and another together allows longer trick combos. While simple, managing
                multiple obstacle relationships enables playgrounds for 12+ trick combos, a complex system design. I
                created runtime pool objects that handle these relationships, prevent repeated objects (sometimes
                fail), and add variety with different obstacle skins.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="outcome">
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>As an academic project, this game (along with all the documentation and analysis behind it) earned me 1st
                in BSc (Hons) Games Programming. It also received some recognition in the student showcase at
                Ravensbourne University London, and I even received an award from the faculty for ‘Best In Show’.
                Although it's still a work in progress with quite a few features to implement, the game is playable, and
                I am pretty happy with how far it has come. If you want to give it a try, contact me to be added to the
                internal testing track.</p>
