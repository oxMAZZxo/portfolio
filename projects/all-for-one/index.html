            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This is a project I developed for the Brackeys 2021.1 Game Jam with Arnas Puskinigis. It is a top-down 2D
                space shooter in which the player controls a spaceship under enemy attack. The goal is to destroy as
                many enemies as possible and avoid running out of ammo by collecting ammo boxes.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="contributions">
            <h3>Personal Contributions</h3>
            <p>While both Arnas and I designed the game, I focused on the programming. I implemented the game systems such as player movement/combat, enemy AI and some audio programming.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="tech-dets">
            <h3>Technical Details</h3>
            <p>This was my first collaboration on making a game, and being a game jam submission made it even more difficult. Making sure I was on task proved to be difficult; however, using Trello at the time made things a bit easier and straightforward. </p>
        </section>

        <section id="challenges">
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>As a relatively novice games programmer, I learnt to develop things step by step, from enemy spawning to the pause menu. Everything bore the hallmarks of a beginner's work. However, this project sharpened my problem-solving and intuition skills through extensive debugging and bug fixing. Additionally, since it was my first time collaborating with someone, I had to consider my work and coding styles, learn to document my code, and become a team player.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="outcome">
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>The outcome was that I participated in my first game jam as part of a two man team, and made a game that was playable. Overall happy with the result.</p>
