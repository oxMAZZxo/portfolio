            <p>The Student Register is a two-part system consisting of the Register app and the Student Sign-In app. Students can sign into school by entering their IDs in the Student Sign-In App, which records their sign-in times as well as the ‘Gate’ from which they signed in. Administrators can monitor the times and locations when students sign in using the Register. The system supports multiple instances for the Sign-In app to be active, and it can be used from one machine or from different machines as long as they are in the same file server. I created this system originally for my A-Level Computer Science coursework project in VB.net. However, it had a lot of flaws, so I decided to re-design and develop it using C# and WPF.</p>
