            <p>I developed Egg Smasher during my study at Ravensbourne University. It took me around 5 weeks to complete the game, which I used as a submission for the Mobile Development mini-module. Initially, I intended to create a fun and casual game, but later on, I decided to integrate Google's Play Games Services into it by using the GPGS Plugin for Unity as well as collaborate with an artist from the Games Development course who helped me figure out the art-style, colour palette, as well as draw the art as well.
                Though I had experience in creating games for Android devices, a lot has changed since my previous game. So, I had to learn new things, and using Play Game Services was a challenge in itself. However, in retrospect, the experience was valuable, and I learned a lot from it.</p>
